# A Brief Introduction

Hey there! My name is Matt Renaud and I'm a software engineer at
Google Inc. working on Search Infrastructure. You can find me most
places online going by the name mrenaud92 (since mrenaud is taken
almost everywhere, except for domain names apparently, go figure). I
really enjoy learning, regardless of what subject, but my main area of
interest is Computer Science. I graduated in June and have just
recently started a full time position as a software engineer at Google
in Mountain View California.

I was first introduced to Computer Science (well, just Linux actually)
around 5 years ago by my uncle Roland and was instantly intrigued when
I saw him banging away at the terminal and stuff was happening! It
turns out that I was somewhat technology sheltered up until that
point.


# Interests

## Tech/CS Related

When it comes to technology, the list of interests that I have is
quite long, and unfortunately, there isn't enough time in the day to
explore all of them so, I'll just put a small list here:

- <span class="heading">Artificial Intelligence</span>

  I'm really excited where this is going to take us in the future.

- <span class="heading">Programming Languages</span>

  I have always been interested in the way that programming languages
  are designed, and how that design effects how you approach solving a
  problem in that language.  In particular, I enjoy writing in C++ but
  I've always had a *thing* for functional languages like Haskell and
  CommonLisp (but I'll get to that in a blog entry sometime).

- <span class="heading">Distributed Computing</span>

  For the last year or so, I've become more and more interested in
  parallel processing and distributed computing. I started out last
  year by writing multi-threaded data structure and algorithms in
  C++ using the new threading library in C++11. I didn't have more
  than one computer so I was somewhat limited in what I could do
  with regards to distributing work across a network.

  During the course of my internship at IBM, I had the opportunity to
  write software that would be running across hundreds of nodes in
  parallel, opering on files stored on a distributed filesystem. My
  time working on the project really gave me a lot of insight and
  experience into the advantages, difficulties, and drawbacks of the
  design of distributed systems.

- <span class="heading">Graphics and Computer Vision</span>

  This semester I decided to take a class on computer graphics using
  OpenGL and I've been having a lot of fun learning about it and I'm
  finding it incredibly interesting. Hopefully at some point in the
  future I'll have a chance to use what I've learned.

## Non-technology Related

I absolutely love being outside whenever I can, which as you can
imagine, clashes epically with my career choice as a computer
scientist (although not in all cases).

- <span class="heading">Exercise</span>

  I pick things up and put them down. Not really, but that is part of
  what I do. I do like to go to the gym, I also enjoy interval
  training, boot camps, and kickboxing. Regurlarly exercising really
  keeps me sane, especially throughout the school year when I have a
  lot of work to do. Since I have moved I have also started rock
  climbing, beach volleyball, ultimate frisbee and mountain biking.

- <span class="heading">Reading</span>

  I never used to, but recently I have gotten in the (good) habbit of
  reading more books. I have noticed, when reading books with
  not-so-common/advanced english in them, that my reading skills are
  not quite as good as I would like them to be, so hopefully over the
  coming years that will improve.

  I finished reading through Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden
  Braid for the first time this (2013) summer, and *wow*, was that an
  absolutely incredible book. I took a little bit of time to reflect
  on what I had learned and discovered through my mental journey, then
  went back to the first chapter and started again. I don't know if I
  will even encounter a book that has changed the way that I think as
  much as GEB.

  I have also started reading some of Asimov's work including his
  robot novels and the foundation series and I've really enjoyed
  them. I recently read Ender's Game and am currently working my way
  through Dune.
